Hello everyone, now I will show you a demo of supermarket goods checking based on C865DK. The model of this demo comes from the coco ssd mobilenet model dedicated to mobile devices provided by Google tensorfolw lite. This model can support the detection of multiple types of goods and their position information at the same time.
We implemented this demo based on the API provided by tensorflow lite and accelerated inference based on the NNAPI provided by Android.
Now let's show the specific effect of this demo. First click on the APP, open the settings, and then add a RTSP video stream, click back, now the model has started to load, and now you can see that the goods on the simulated shelf have been detected, and there are 3 mouses and 3 apples, include position information.
